<h2>Five Trends Driving the Future of Mobile Marketing</h2>
<p>The average American spends at least <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/informate-report-social-media-smartphone-use/">five hours</a>  on their smartphone. So why is it so hard to make mobile ads work? Marketers tirelessly measure clicks and conversions on narrowly targeted ads, but users, tired of intrusive banners, keep installing ad blockers. With $100B in annual mobile ad
	<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Ad-Spend-Top-100-Billion-Worldwide-2016-51-of-Digital-Market/1012299">spend at stake</a>, someone has to figure out a way to fix
	this disconnect.
	<br>
	<br>
	And the good news is, the latest mobile trends show promise that publishers and advertisers are getting smarter about user experience. Google is working to recapture lost attention with a crackdown on mobile pop-ups, and marketers are easing off their aggressive acquisition strategies to focus on retention. While some digital trends such as immersive VR and AR ads will take years to collect sizeable audiences, others, like mobile wallets and chatbots, are already powering millions of daily brand-consumer interactions on mobile. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the biggest trends in
	mobile advertising.
	<br>
</p>
<h3>Trend #1. Mobile Merges Digital and Offline Experiences </h3>
<p>Mobile payment at the physical point of sale is growing in the U.S., with over $314 billion in payments <a
		href="https://www.emarketer.com/Report/US-Mobile-Payments-Outlook-Strong-Growth-Forecast-Proximity-Peer-to-Peer-Payments-2017-Beyond/2001890">expected
	by 2020</a>. But the revenue from these purchases represent just a fraction of the value marketers will get from collecting transactional data. In the past, brands had to rely on loyalty points programs to peek into consumer purchase behavior. These programs were largely ineffective for lack of creativity in implementation and the resulting general consumer fatigue. Apple and Samsung have now made proximity mobile payments mainstream, and integrations such as Urban Airship support automatic rewards program enrollment, reducing consumer friction. Mobile payments will be a critical tool to collect data for predictive targeting and triggered personalized messaging based on location and time. Starbucks, for example, already allows coffee drinkers pay in-store or order ahead with their mobile wallet app. The brand learns more about its loyal customers not only from their location or the drinks they purchase, but also from their
	<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/what-your-music-taste-says-about-your-personality-a6749866.html">music preferences</a> (you can build a playlist within the app). Sephora to Go app recommends new products based on your purchase history and pushes a notification on your phone or smart watch whenever you’re around their store.

<h3>Trend #2. Shorter Videos to Drive Performance Marketing</h3>

	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">More than half</a> of all YouTube views come from mobile devices. LTE towers are growing in numbers to satisfy our
		<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canada-says-high-speed-internet-is-essential-for-quality-of-life-a7490716.html">basic needs</a> for high-speed Internet, and more public places enable free WiFi access. Thanks to these technology enhancements and lower cost of hardware, mobile video now plays freely and speedily on trains, subways, and crosswalks.
		<br>
		<br>
		And advertisers love video ads, because consumers do, too. Video format is engaging: <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.000rcs5x9154keu0t241dxkjcffvd">80% of users</a> recall a video ad they viewed in the past 30 days.
		Video easily accommodates native publisher formats and offers multiple options for mobile placement – pre-, mid, and post-roll ads, interstitials in apps, video banners, etc.

	<p>
		Brands have quickly adopted video format for on-the-go content consumption in social media feeds – by radically trimming the clips’ length and adding text overlay for users who don’t have headphones at hand in a public space. Google’s multi-billion video inventory tailors to all kinds of interests, so marketers can go very niche with targeting.<br><br>

		For smaller brands, production cost is clearly a barrier to creating more video ads: not every advertiser has a budget the size of Nike’s to create high-quality videos and the resources to manage localization for text overlay. And for every sizeable investment there’s an expectation for a good return: so, marketers are focusing more on specific performance metrics, and less on brand awareness goals. For example, Machine Zone has been very successful in driving app downloads through its Super Bowl video commercials – featuring Kate Upton last year, and Arnold Schwarzenegger this year.
	</p>

	<h3>Trend #3. One-on-One Conversations with Brands Through Chatbots</h3>

	<p>
		Chatbots provide a conversation interface where making a purchase is as easy as sending a text. Conversation sets the foundation for selling and good customer service – just think of your closest local mom-and-pop store. And chatbots are scaling one-on-one interactions to cater to millions of consumers. Whole Foods, for example, has a Facebook bot that assists shoppers with recipe suggestions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Chatbots may seem like yet another way to replace sales associates and speed up consumer orders (pizza, uber, or a pair of jeans). But there’s more.The wealth of data that these chatbots have about a particular Facebook user allow brands to learn about this user’s preferences and personalize communications accordingly. Deep machine learning algorithms will improve bots over time, giving them a competitive edge over any local shop assistant in predicting consumer behavior. And with transactional communications via Facebook Messenger, such as shipping updates and confirmation messages, brands can upsell and cross-sell products and services directly in a shopper’s inbox right next to their friends’ messages.

	<h3>Trend #4. Less Talking, More Listening</h3>

	<p>
		Voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Line’s Clova allow brands to listen – literally – to their consumers. From being a tap away on their wrists with Fitbit and Apple Watch to connecting smart bottles to NFC smartphones, brands have now many sophisticated ways to collect consumer data using the IoT. <br><br>
		Amazon Echo’s Alexa is getting traction, with over <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/8-million-people-amazon-echo-customer-awareness-increases-dramatically/">8M smart device owners</a> and a growing partner network
		which now includes brands like Domino’s, Uber, and Jamie Oliver. It’s not clear how much data brands get from Alexa outside of the number of times an order has been made via a voice command, but getting deeper insights from consumer audio data will definitely be useful for retention marketing and lookalike targeting in the future.

	<h3>Trend #5. Native Ads: Video Captures More Eyeballs, But Mobile Search -- More Pockets
	</h3>

	<p>
		Snap recently went public at $24 per share, capturing a growing slice of B2C marketing budgets with a promise to reach Millennials, today’s most coveted demographic, through native video content. Native ads are expected to take up to
		<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2017/03/21/native-ads-arrive-theyll-be-half-of-all-display-spending-this-year/#379ff9575c95">53%</a> of all display spending this
		year, and largely on mobile. <br><br>

		Native advertisements, unlike typical banner ads, often look like organic publisher content: the branded (“promoted”) stories on Facebook, Snapchat filters, and sponsored articles on Buzzfeed are all examples of native ads. People tend
		<a href="http://www.sharethrough.com/resources/in-feed-ads-vs-banner-ads/">to pay more attention</a> to native ads. At the same time, some studies show that users
		<a href="https://techscience.org/a/2015121503/">feel cheated</a> when they click on an advertorial that wasn’t clearly labeled as such.

		</a><figcaption>Local search ads got easier with app-in-app integrations such as Maps - OpenTable
	</figcaption>
	</figure>



	<p>
		Search ads, the most popular native ad type (and by far the most <a href="http://digiday.com/media/search-native-advertisings-new-pricing-models/">accessible</a> one), are morphing into new formats as Internet giants like Google, Apple, and Tencent are adding new app integrations into their mobile ecosystems. For example, people can get a Lyft within Maps app or book a table via OpenTable. Such search partnerships create a win-win situation for vendors, who get an easy entry to the market, and publishers who are building mobile
		ecosystems: <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/WeChat-More-than-Basic-Messaging-App/1014328">WeChat</a>’s ARPU (average revenue per user) is estimated at over $7, with over 8,000 brands currently using the platform. What a lucrative way to retain users and keep them engaged within one app!

	<h3>Summary: Watch the Trends, But Start with the Basics</h3>

	<p>
		The latest trends like mobile wallets, video, chatbots, IoT, and native ads are changing the marketing game. Armed with more sophisticated ways to collect data and personalize messages at scale, marketers will use these innovations to engage and retain high-value customers.

	</p>


	<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Mobile is merging digital and offline experiences. Mobile payments will help marketers get deeper insights into consumer purchasing behavior.
		</li>
		<li>Video ads will drive more engagement on mobile. Flexible options for mobile placement and speedy mobile Internet will drive higher adoption of video and other interactive ad formats.</li>
		<li>Chatbots will scale one-on-one brand communications. Social media data and smart learning algorithms will personalize interactions and enable brands to cross-sell products and services via transactional messages.
		</li>
		<li>As shopping via voice assistants is getting traction, marketers will need to figure out ways to collect data from home devices while respecting privacy.
		</li>
		<li>Native video ads will win on engagement, but mobile search will drive more conversions because of higher relevancy
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		All that said, marketers don’t have to – and really shouldn’t – implement all the latest innovations to reach people on mobile. And most consumers are likely
		<a href="http://www.reportlinker.com/insight/americans-perplexed-about-vr.html">not ready</a> for the hottest shiny new things such as smart sensor bottles or AR/VR ads. For many marketers –and it may seem blatantly obvious – monitoring mobile data with Google Analytics and working with developers to fix the mobile web is a good place to start listening.
